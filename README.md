*training project*

#### Hey there guys,

This project is actually a training job done as a homework (as I'm new to all this and in the process of learning).

This is mostly done in entry-level React, aided by a little bit of pure JS (and also tools e.g. JSX, axios, etc.).   
I'd be more than glad if anyone would check it out and kindly leave a comment or drop a suggestion if you have any.

> Contact me if you want to contribute, and feel free to use my code to make your own modified version (although a mention somewhere in your README file would be highly appeciated).

Feel free to contact me if you have any problems understanding what I did.

Regards,   
**Mehrdad**
